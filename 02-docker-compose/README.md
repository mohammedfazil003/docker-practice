# What is docker compose?

> Docker-compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

##### We can run our project in one go with the following command and all the images will be created and container would be started with the name specified in the yaml file:

``` docker compose up ```
